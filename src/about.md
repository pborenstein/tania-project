About a week ago
I got an email  from
my uncle Isidoro.
Attached to the email
were 25 jpegs of two-page spreads
of a book written in Russian.

The book is a memoir of Tania Mostkoff
put together by her son, Nahum Baskin.
Tania is my Zeide Luis's sister,
my great aunt.

The pictures I got from my uncle
were pictures of the book.

I thought it would be interesting
to try to scan the pages and translate them.
