title: What is this?
---

About a week ago
I got an email  from
my uncle Isidoro.
Attached to the email
were 25 jpegs of two-page spreads
of a book written in Russian.

The book is a memoir of Tania Mostkoff
put together by her son Nahum Baskin.
Tania is my zeide Luis's sister,
my great aunt.

My partner, Wendy, is an avid genealogist.
She's been researching my mother's line,
and while my Bobe Chelo's line has been
fairly easy to track, Luis's is a little
bit harder. She learned that Luis's
sister, Tania's son had put together
a memoir of his mother.

The pictures I got from my uncle
were pictures of the book.
